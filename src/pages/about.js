			<h2>About project</h2>
			<p>
				I created a photo app to showcase my skills in building user-friendly
				applications. I used Unsplash's API to integrate their vast collection
				of high-quality, copyright-free photos. By registering the app on
				Unsplash and utilizing API endpoints I can search for photos based on
				various criteria. Proper authentication and attribution ensure the
				correct usage of images. Optimized image URLs enhance the user
				experience.
			</p>
			<p>
				This project highlights my API integration expertise and frontend
				capabilities.
			</p>
			<p> Happy Codings!</p>
